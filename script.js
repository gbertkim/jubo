It is called the 5 day plan and is also available on the Dwell App. We highly encourage you to download and use this app, particularly if you want to grow in God’s Word but have found it difficult to stick to a reading plan. If you’d like a printed schedule for January, one will be available at our Connect Table.`

    title: `WORSHIP IN SONG`,
    description: `Although everything in our lives is meant to be worship to God, we believe that a worshipful life is cultivated through the gathering of believers in a corporate setting. Singing in these gatherings helps us to be educated theologically, engage God emotionally, and express our unity as we celebrate the gospel together.`

It sets forth our beliefs in a beautiful simplicity, brevity and order. For believers, reciting the Apostles Creed each Sunday allows us to remember and affirm our faith in God the Father, the person and work of Jesus Christ, the Holy Spirit, and the Universal (Christian) Church.`

    title: `GIVING OFFERING`,
    description: `We believe that giving is a personal and private act of worship. If you are new or just visiting today, please do not feel obligated to give. For those of us who have prepared an offering for today, let’s give freely and cheerfully out of a response to God’s generous grace.`

They offer words of assurance designed to bring joy, peace, comfort, and security to those who place their trust in God. We close each worship service this way that we might leave blessed and be empowered to bless others.`
